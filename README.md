# Motivation
As of today, there isn't any forum where we can discuss formats as Historic or MtgArena general questions.

Right now the community has reddit, but as Reddit works, we can't have long discussions about decks or the meta. It all gets forgotten in the time it takes to dissapear from the frontpage.

MtgSalvation is dead. The rest of the communities are behind a paywall, and there isn't a discussion forum.

In my opinion, this is the work WOTC should be doing, not me, but they are not interested in this it seems.

# Future

In the future I would like to make an extra app to get the data of all the games. I hope that the app is multiplatform and works on Windows, Linux, Mac, IOS and Android. It seems possible, as it only have to parse the logs and send them to the database. The objective of the app would be only that, parse data. I'm not interested in making an overlay, as I think there are far more options, but if the community wants it, we could try to make it happen, just not a priority at all right now.

That app would be free, and the access to the data too, so we as a community can discuss it freely.

It is necessary for Mtg:Arena to have an history of the matches, and I think that decks you play against should be open for all, so you can make choices in the field you are playing more rationally. Also as a curious person, you often lose to jank and want to know what the hell was that. Brew visibility breeds creativity in the community.
